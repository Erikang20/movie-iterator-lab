# Movie iterator lab!

This lab will let you practice working with the iterators `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. To get started, run `npm install` and then take a look at the functions in `main.js`. Write code to get the tests to pass. For reference, the movie data that the tests will use (and that you're encouraged to use as well) is in `movies.js`.

Good luck!
